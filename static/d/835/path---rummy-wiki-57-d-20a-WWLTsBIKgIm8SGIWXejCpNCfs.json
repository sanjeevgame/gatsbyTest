The losing players get points equal to the total value of their unmatched or unarranged cards at the end of each deal. When a player’s score reaches 101 points, he/she is eliminated from the game and the player who survives till the end is declared the winner.</p>\n<p><strong>201 Pool Rummy:</strong> The game of 201 Pool Rummy is the same as the game of 101 Pool Rummy except that the players are eliminated when they reach 201 points. The player who makes it till the end without accumulating 201 points wins the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Aces:</strong> A standard deck of 52 cards used in rummy contains 4 Aces. They come in the different suits of Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Aces can be used to form a lower-value sequence like Ace 2, 3, or they can be used to form a sequence with high cards, for example Ace, King and Queen. The points carried by each ace are 10. If a printed Joker is selected as the wild Joker, then Aces also function as wild Jokers, along with the printed Joker.</p>\n<p><strong>Best of Three:</strong> It is a form of Deals Rummy where players play for three rounds.
