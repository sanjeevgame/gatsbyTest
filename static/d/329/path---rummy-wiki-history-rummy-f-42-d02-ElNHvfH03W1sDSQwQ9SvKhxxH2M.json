However, if you ask about the origin of the game, it is not an easy question. There are many theories associating the origin of the game with different places around the world but the exact place of origin is very difficult to ascertain. Some of the popular and decisive theories about the history of rummy are as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"tabcontentarea\">\n<div class=\"tabcontent\" id=\"tab2\">\n<h2>The Spanish and American Connection</h2>\n<p>Many theorists connect the origin of the game to Spanish communities and believe that early Spanish communities who moved to the West developed it. Such theories are based on the striking resemblance of rummy to the Spanish game of Conquian. Some other theorists say that it originated in America and later it reached Mexico, where it was called Conquian.</p>\n<h2>The Poker Theory</h2>\n<p>Some theorists believe that French settlers in the West developed rummy from poker. The propagators of this theory say that rummy and poker share similar concepts of forming sequences and groups. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarne\"><u>John Scarne</u></a>, a famous author on card games, rummy was derived from the card game called Whiskey Poker and was later known as Rum Poker, which was later renamed Rum, and finally called Rummy.</p>\n<h2>The Asian Connection</h2>\n<p>The history of rummy could be traced back to the first game of draw and discard pattern: the Chinese card game of Mah Jong. This game was first developed during the Tang dynasty in China, over 1,000 years ago. Other theories link it to the Japanese game of Hanafuda, which was developed by the Portuguese who travelled to Japan. Hanafuda became a popular gambling game with different card designs in the mid-17th century.</p>\n<p>There are many other theories that link it to other games and countries. It is difficult to arrive at a conclusion about the definite origin and history of rummy. Whatever the origin could have been, what makes the game special is that it is widely played all over the world across boundaries and unites people with an array of variations.</p>\n<p>Play online rummy on <a href=\"https://www.jungleerummy.com/\">JungleeRummy</a> and find out which of the features of online rummy connect well to the above theories about the history of the game.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about online rummy, click on the following links:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.jungleerummy.com/rummy-faq\">Rummy FAQs</a> | <a href=\"https://www.jungleerummy.com/rummy-variations/cash-rummy\">Cash Rummy</a> | <a href=\"https://www.jungleerummy.com/rummy-variations/free-rummy\">Free Rummy</a> | <a href=\"https://www.jungleerummy.com/rummy-variations\">Variations of Rummy</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"History Rummy","date":"May 28, 2015","description":"this conatain description"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/rummy-wiki/history-rummy/"}}
